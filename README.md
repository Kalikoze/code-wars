# Code Wars Exercises
This repository contains a collection of code challenges from CodeWars. To level up my experience with languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, I am complete multiple different exercises in all three!

## Cloning the Repository
To run any of the files locally on your machine, run these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `javascript` | `typescript` | `python` directory in your terminal.
3. Make sure you have Python and Node.js installed on your machine.
4. Run the following command to execute a file:
For Python files you will run:
```
  python split_strings.py
```
For Javascript files you will run:
```
  node detect-pangram.js
```
5. Compare the outputs to the expected results in the file!

## Reflections
Working on these Code Wars exercises has been an exciting journey for me. It has provided me with an opportunity to compare and contrast the different methods and data structures available in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.

Having worked with JavaScript for seven years, I am quite familiar with its syntax and features. However, delving into TypeScript for the past six months has been a refreshing experience. TypeScript's static typing and enhanced tooling have greatly improved my development workflow and helped catch potential errors early on.

On the other hand, my experience with Python has been relatively short, only a couple of weeks. Nevertheless, I have been thoroughly impressed with the flexibility and expressiveness of the language. Python's extensive standard library and rich ecosystem of third-party packages have made it a joy to work with.

Comparing and contrasting these three languages has given me a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. It has also broadened my perspective on problem-solving and the different approaches that can be taken.

Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python through these Code Wars exercises. It has been a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to further expanding my skills in these languages.
